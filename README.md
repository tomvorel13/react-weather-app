# WEATHER NOW APP #

This is my first React application that I created with React, Axios for data-fetching from the Openweather API and SASS for my CSS.

I will be adding new features and styles to this app in the future. If you are an experienced React dev and you have somhow stumbled upon this repo, let me know what you liked/didn't like. I would appreciate feedback as well as constructive criticism.

The app is now live on Heroku, see the link: https://weather-now-app.herokuapp.com/
